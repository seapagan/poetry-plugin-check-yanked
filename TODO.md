# TODO

- Add pre-commit integration - ensure it only works on changed `popetry.lock`
  files for it will be slow on large projects
- Offer to update any yanked packages to the latest version, or show a list of
  newer versions
- add options to clear the cache, re-check all project deps, ignore the cache
  etc
- automatically re-check older cache entries after a certain amount of time
  (say, 1 day or 1 week).
